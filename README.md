Tip:
---

If new line is necessery during typing - click on Spacebar and then click on
ENTER key. Otherwise the word counter will consider it as a one word (continuous word).

If new line is not necessery you can just type continuously and new line will
break automatically. The counter will work correctly as it should be.
